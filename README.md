# Alabama Slammers Responsive Website Project

A Website created in order to represent an online presence for a 90's rockabilly/ swing band "Alabama Slammers".
 
## UX
 
Website was designed for band's current, returning and prospect fans, people that like rockabilly and swing music from 90's and like to be throwed back to that period of time and for those who are looking for a band to book for an event or would like to feature "Alabama Slammers".

Website users are visiting the site in order to keep updated with what the band is up to, follow tour dates and purchase tickets, check new CD relieces and purchase them, check out video and photo gallaries as well as to listen to band's music. They might also want to contact band for press coverage and/ or book the band for an event.

 Website is responsive, understandable and easy to usse. All the sections are clearly identified in the navigation and presented on it's own page. links to external sources provided, there is no uneccesary content therefore user is always aware of where they are, how they got there and how to go back. It is clearly identified by using buttons and forms of what is expected from a user to acheive desired results. Website design was inspired by 90's decade, colour palette and fonts used were intended to create a feel of 90's aesthetic while still be relatable and appealing for a modern user. There was no unecessary decoration used in order to maintain a clean design which is aesthetically apealing and relavent.
