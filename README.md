A responsive website for a rock'n'roll/Swing/Rythm & Blues band "Alabama Slammers". Website consists of eight pages featuring home page which consists of a video from latest concert an option to buy newest CD and the subscription to the mailing list, two galleries for band's tour pictures and videos, page for listening and purchasing latest music, about page providing a brief history of the band, a page dedicated to check out tour dates and purchase tickets and a contact page which provides user with two different contact options depending on the reason for getting in touch. 

The primary purpose of this page is to create an online presence for the band that would fully represent what they are trying to comunicate through their band image and music style. 

<ol>Long term goals for the page are:
<li>To keep current fan base informed about latest news and events as well as provide fans a place to track new releases and purchase media and tickets in one place providing convenience and motivation to come back.</li>

<li>To gain new fans providing a decade appropriate style and feel for the page as well as an easy way of navigation and buttons linkink pages that would encourage new uset to check all the content and stay on the page as long as possible</li>
</ol>

UX
 
Website was designed for band's current, returning and prospect fans, people that like rockabilly and swing music from 90's and like to be throwed back to that period of time and for those who are looking for a band to book for an event or would like to feature "Alabama Slammers".

Website users are visiting the site in order to keep updated with what the band is up to, follow tour dates and purchase tickets, check new CD relieces and purchase them, check out video and photo gallaries as well as to listen to band's music. They might also want to contact band for press coverage and/ or book the band for an event.

 Website is responsive, understandable and easy to usse. All the sections are clearly identified in the navigation and presented on it's own page. links to external sources provided, there is no uneccesary content therefore user is always aware of where they are, how they got there and how to go back. It is clearly identified by using buttons and forms of what is expected from a user to acheive desired results. Website design was inspired by 90's decade, colour palette and fonts used were intended to create a feel of 90's aesthetic while still be relatable and appealing for a modern user. There was no unecessary decoration used in order to maintain a clean design which is aesthetically apealing and relavent.

- As an old fan of the band, I want to be able to access tour dates and see the newest gigs first, I want an easy access to buy tickets fast, I also want to be updated about any news regarding the band via email.

- As a new fan I want to be able to learn more about the band and check out media I haven't seen, heard before and purchase a CD.

- As the writter for a music blog I would like to feature a band there fore I need to find a correct person to contact for this purpose.

- As a person who is organising a wedding party I need to know who is a right person to contact in order tohire this band.

Please check out /wireframes folder included to familiarize with design choices that were created before building a website.

The website is fully responsive. Desktop version has more visual information and more complex layout while in mobile version content is stacked and less visual elements are used in order to save space creating less scrolling, there fore better user experience. Through the navigation user is able to access: contact page which consists of two contact forms for different purpouses (forms require user to input information, however they don't actually send message), 
media page which allows user to check out pictures,videos and music, tour page where latest tour dates are displayed and from where user can purchase tickets (on the push of the button user is directed to a page where tickets are sold),
about page where a brief bio of the band is displayed.
Once pressed on the logo user is directed back to landing page where they can watch a video and if interested press a button to watch more and be redirected to videos page, user can always buy a CD and subscribe to a mailing list (anybody that subscribed won't actually receive an email).
Footer consists of social media links (as the band is no longer existant these links lead to the main pages of each social media platform).

Testing

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
